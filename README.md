# Hand Gesture based Volume Control
This application is maily developed for Mac/Linux operating systems. 

An amazing hand recognition application, where you can control the volume of your system using your hand.

Just like the gesture we use to zoom in and zoom out on any touch screen or trackpad, you can use the same gesture in front of the camera to control the volume
